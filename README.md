# Differential Levelling

Differential levelling is commonly performed with a specific levelling instrument. It is also possible to do it with a total station,
which can be even more efficient over areas with large changes in elevation.

The method is outlined in [ICSM SP1](https://www.icsm.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-12/Guideline-for-Control-Surveys-by-Differential-Levelling_v2.2.pdf), and this work aims to help with understanding of the technique.

## Getting Started

Read through the PDF called "USQ\_TS Differential Levelling Procedure\_v2.2.pdf".

## Trimble Stylesheet

A stylesheet has been written to output the observations from a total station levelling survey in standard level book format (BS, IS, FS, Rise, Fall, RL).

Upload the stylesheet to your data recorder and export the job, ensuring that Save As PDF is turned off - must be output as a html file.

Alternatively, download the File and Report Generator from the Software Utility downloads section of [this page](https://help.trimblegeospatial.com/TrimbleAccess/latest/en/Downloads-software.htm).
